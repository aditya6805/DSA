# DSA
Here is my DSA programs.
DSA forms the bedrock of efficient and effective software development.
The word Data Structure relates to the storage and organizing of data, whereas Algorithm refers to the step-by-step technique for solving a problem. Data structure and algorithms are an area of computer science that implements the production of machine-efficient and optimized computer programs. We improve software engineering codes by merging "data structure" and "algorithm."
